        <p>Canada is expected to compete at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games have been postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[1] Since the nation's debut in 1900, Canadian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the country's support for United States-led boycott. </p>
        <p>Before the official postponement, the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee initially announced their intention not to send teams to both the Olympics and Paralympics.[2] Following the announcement on the postponement, the COC and CPC issued a statement that says, in part, that Team Canada "will rise to the challenge to showcase our very best on the international stage," without explicitly saying that Canadian athletes will take part in the games.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"> In 1924, the Canadian ice hockey team took the top spot in Chamonix, France establishing a strong precedence for Canada.
            As with the Summer Games, Canada is also one of the top countries in the Winter Games winning Olympic medals in every outing and in 2010,
            Canada put up their best performance yet in the Winter Games.</p>
